The dataset includes 80 images.
Sghug are annotated in COCO Segmentation format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -45째 to +45째 horizontally and -45째 to +45째 vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
